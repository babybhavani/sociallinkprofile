### Useful resources

- [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for grid layout. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Greek for Greeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-grid-layout-the-fr-unit/?ref=header_search) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand grid. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
